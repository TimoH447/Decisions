# Project
This short project tries to predict your next move. 

I saw years ago a website where the user could click two buttons while an simple algorithm predicts
the next key. Because Humans are bad at making random decisions the predictions were above 50% right.
I forgot the name of the website, so I tried to code the algorith myself.
